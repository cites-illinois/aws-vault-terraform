## Design

Vault provides a Docker image that we will run on ECS, with one server per
availability zone to give high availability. Vault runs in a master/standby
configuration and not a load balanced configuration. This means that deploying
more servers does not give you more performance.

Connections made to a standby server will be forwarded on the backend to the
master. Some clients can also request that the standby server redirect them
to the master server. To support redirection, each server is directly accessible
without the load balancer.

<a id="design-dns"/>

### DNS

You will need to plan for the following hostnames, which will be registered
after the terraform is successfully run.

| Kind      | Resource      | Example                             | Description |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Primary   | Load Balancer | vault.example.illinois.edu          | This will be the primary endpoint for clients to contact. |
| Server A  | EC2 Instance  | server-a.vault.example.illinois.edu | Hostname for the server in Availability Zone A |
| Server B  | EC2 Instance  | server-b.vault.example.illinois.edu | Hostname for the server in Availability Zone B |

If you have more than two servers then expand the scheme appropriately.

<a id="design-storage"/>

### Storage: DynamoDB

Vault stores its data in DynamoDB, which is one of the highly available backends.
The DynamoDB Table is encrypted at rest by AWS and the data is individually
encrypted by Vault. Point In Time Recovery (PITR) is enabled on the table to
support rolling back the storage to a previous version.

<a id="design-keys"/>

### Master Keys: Secrets Manager

Each Vault server starts in a sealed state and needs several master keys to
unseal. This terraform stores those master keys in AWS Secrets Manager and
launches a helper to unseal a newly started Vault server. The master keys secret
is protected with its own AWS KMS Custom Key.

<a id="design-auth"/>

### Authentication: UOFI AD & AWS

You must provide a set of AD group names of people with admin access to the Vault
server. The first time this terraform is deployed it will configure Vault to
allow full access to these users, and also configure the EC2 instance to allow
SSH/sudo access. SSH access is given by public/private key authentication, so
configure your admin users in AD with their SSH public keys.

**Not all components are configured to support nested groups. For best results
make sure that your admin groups have direct members and not nested members.**

This terraform also enables AWS authentication which allows you to use AWS users
and roles to authenticate.

<a id="design-logging"/>

### Logging: CloudWatch Logs

Logs from the Docker containers will be stored in CloudWatch Logs. You can then
stream these logs to other systems, like Splunk. This terraform will also
enable Vault auditing and store those logs in CloudWatch Logs and on the EC2
instance the server is running on.

Two audit methods are used because Vault will not run with auditing enabled
unless at least one method is available. In case of a disaster most data on the
EC2 instance can be reconstructed using the terraform, however the audit logs
stored on the EC2 instance will be lost. You can recover them from CloudWatch
Logs.

CloudWatch Logs are encrypted at rest using the AWS KMS Custom key. The logs
on the instances are stored on encrypted EBS volumes using the AWS provided key.

<a id="design-not-fargate"/>

### Why Not Fargate?

Fargate is a new AWS serverless technology for running Docker containers. It was
considered for this project but rejected for several reasons:

1. No support for `IPC_LOCK`. Vault tries to lock its memory so that secret data
   is never swapped to disk. Although it seems unlikely Fargate swaps to disk, the
   lock capability is not provided.

2. Running on EC2 makes configuring Vault easier. The Ansible playbooks included
   with this terraform build the Vault configuration for each server. It would
   be much harder to do this in a Fargate environment with sidecar containers or
   custom Vault images.

3. Running on EC2 makes DNS configuration easier. The Vault redirection method
   means you need to know the separate DNS endpoint names and doing this on Fargate
   is complicated. With EC2 we register some ElasticIPs and use those for the
   individual servers.

Many of these problems could be solved by running Vault in a custom image. However,
it seemed valuable to use the Hashicorp Vault image instead of relying on custom
built ones, so EC2 was chosen as the ECS technology.

## Software Requirements

This is an advanced terraform to deploy. You will need to have some
understanding of **Ansible**, **AWS CLI**, **Docker**, **Linux**, **SSH**, and
**terraform** before being able to use this terraform. This terraform uses
`local-exec` provisioners that assume a Linux environment with Ansible, AWS CLI,
and Docker available. You will need to install and configure several tools
before running the terraform.

Since Ansible and the AWS CLI are python projects it might be helpful to create
a virtual environment and install these tools inside of it. A `requirements.txt`
is provided for people who want to do this.

<a id="software-ansible"/>

### Ansible

Ansible must be available as the `ansible-playbook` command and version 2.4 or
newer. Older 2.x versions might work but have not been tested. Ansible is used
to configure the EC2 instances that will be launched.

You can use Ansible to keep the EC2 instances updated after deploying this
terraform.

<a id="software-ansible-macports"/>

#### MacPorts

```
sudo port install py36-ansible ansible_select
sudo port select --set ansible py36-ansible
```

<a id="software-ansible-ubuntu1804"/>

#### Ubuntu 18.04

```
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

<a id="software-awscli"/>

### AWS CLI

The AWS CLI must be available as the `aws` command and version 1.15.10 or newer.
Older versions might work but have not been tested. The AWS CLI is used to
launch ECS tasks to initialize vault.

<a id="software-awscli-macports"/>

#### MacPorts

```
sudo port install py36-awscli awscli_select
sudo port select --set awscli py36-awscli
```

<a id="software-awscli-ubuntu1804"/>

#### Ubuntu 18.04

```
sudo apt-get install awscli
```

<a id="software-docker"/>

### Docker

Docker must be available as the `docker` command locally. You can run the daemon
remotely and use `DOCKER_HOST` but it is easier to run Docker Community Edition
locally for your platform.

Terraform uses the docker daemon to lookup the image hashes for the ECS Tasks.
This makes sure that even if you use the `latest` tag you will still get
updates.

Downloads: [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac);
[Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows).

<a id="software-docker-wsl"/>

#### Windows Subsystems for Linux

If you are using Docker for Windows and running the terraform in Windows
Subsystems for Linux then you need to set Docker to listen on `localhost:2375`.
Then from in the WSL terminal:

```
apt-get install docker.io
export DOCKER_HOST='tcp://localhost:2375'
```

You will need to set `DOCKER_HOST` for each new terminal you launch.

<a id="software-ssh"/>

### SSH

Several of these tools will use SSH public/private key authentication to
connect to the EC2 instances. If you already have a key pair in AWS then you can
use that, but if not then you should generate one and store the private key on
the machine you'll use to run the terraform.

If you do not already have an SSH key then you can create one quickly. This
creates a key with a comment of "vault key" and no password. You will either
need to have no password for the key or add it to your SSH Agent for the
terraform to work.

```
mkdir ~/.ssh && chmod g=,o= ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C 'vault key' -N '' -f ~/.ssh/vault
```

<a id="software-terraform"/>

### Terraform

Terraform must be available as the `terraform` command and version 0.11.7 or
newer.

[Terraform Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).


<a id="setup"/>

## Setup

A couple resources must exist before running the terraform. **Make sure to switch
to the "Ohio" region in the console before performing these steps!**

<a id="setup-awscli"/>

### AWS CLI

If you do not already AWS CLI configured then create an IAM user with
"programmatic access" only. For permissions attached the existing
"AdministatorAccess" policy. "PowerUserAccess" is not enough because this
terraform creates IAM roles and policies.

As the last step of creating the user you will get a CSV file with the access
key and secret access key. Run `aws configure` and use these values. For
default region us "us-east-2" (although the region is encoded in the terraform).

<a id="setup-keypair"/>

### SSH Key Pair: EC2

Take your existing SSH public key or the one you created earlier (`vault.pub`)
and import it as a Key Pair in the EC2 section. The name you give it during the
import will be used later when setting up the variables file.

<a id="setup-terraform-dynamodb"/>

### Terraform Locking: DynamoDB

Terraform uses a DynamoDB table to lock the remote state so that several people
working on the same terraform do not conflict. This is valuable even if a single
person is using the terraform since you might often work on multiple
workstations.

You can share the same table among multiple terraform projects. The easiest
thing to do is create a table called `terraform` with a partition key named
`LockID` (string).

<a id="setup-deploy-bucket"/>

### Deployment Bucket: S3

To bootstrap some of the resources secure materials must be stored in S3. This
bucket can also be used for storing the terraform remote state. Create a bucket
with versioning enabled and AES-256 encryption with the AWS managed key.

<a id="setup-ssl"/>

### SSL Certificate Files and AWS Certificate Manager

You will need an SSL SAN certificate with the primary and all server hostnames
in it. You can use a self-signed certificate or one issued by the campus
certificate manager.

You can create the key and certificate signing request with this command:

```
openssl req -new \
    -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout server.key -keyform PEM -nodes \
    -out server.csr -outform PEM
# Country Name: US
# State or Province Name: Illinois
# Locality Name: Urbana
# Organization Name: University of Illinois
# Organizational Unit Name: Urbana-Champaign Campus
# Common Name: vault.example.illinois.edu (your primary name here)
# Email Address: blank
# Challenge Password: blank
# Company Name: blank
```

[Submit the request](https://go.illinois.edu/sslrequest) and include your server
domains in addition to the primary domain. For example, if your service will
be at "vault.example.illinois.edu" and you're running 2 servers then your request
will be:

* Certificate Type: Multi-Domain SSL
* FQDN of the server: vault.example.illinois.edu
* Additional domains: server-a.vault.example.illinois.edu,
  server-b.vault.example.illinois.edu
* HTTP Server Vendor: Other
* Certificate signing request: contents of the `server.csr` file
* Notes: Vault server

*Self-Signed or Private CA: left as an exercise for the reader.*

Once you've received your signed certificate back you need to construct a file
called `server.crt` with the signed certificate and the two InCommon
intermediary certificates:

```

```

*Self-Signed or Private CA: do not include the intermediary certificates listed
above. Instead, include your own CA certificate.*

Upload the `server.key`, `server.csr`, and `server.crt` files to the S3
deployment bucket. Make sure you follow this process:

* Set Permissions: **do not give public read**. The defaults should only list
  your own account. The terraform will give itself permissions to the bucket.
* Set Properties
    * Encryption: select "Amazon S3 master-key". Do not use a custom key to
      encrypt the files.
    * Header: add "Content-Type" as "text/plain". Make sure to **click "Save"**
      or your value might be ignored!

You will also need to import the certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
The certificate in ACM is required for the load balancer.

* Certificate body: the contents of the signed certificate, excluding the
  intermediary certificates.
* Certificate private key: the content of `server.key`.
* Certificate chain: the intermediary certificates.

<a id="setup-ldap"/>

### LDAP Authenticated Bind

For configuring SSSD and Vault LDAP authentication we need an LDAP user to bind
to the directory for searching and reading attributes. You can create a new user
in your own OU or use an existing one appropriate for these purposes.

**Note: the LDAP user will need access to the memberOf attribute. You will need
to [request access to memberOf](https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/page.php?id=48115).**

Create a new text file called `ldap-credentials.txt` with this format. The file
should only have two lines where the first is a username format suitable for
binding (DN, Domain\\User, or User@FQDN) and the second is the password.

```
MyUserName@ad.uillinois.edu
MyRandomPassword
```

Upload the `ldap-credentials.txt` file to the S3 deployment bucket. Make sure
you follow this process:

* Set Permissions: **do not give public read**. The defaults should only list
  your own account. The terraform will give itself permissions to the bucket.
* Set Properties
    * Encryption: select "Amazon S3 master-key". Do not use a custom key to
      encrypt the file.
    * Header: add "Content-Type" as "text/plain". Make sure to **click "Save"**
      or your value might be ignored!

<a id="terraform-variables"/>

## Terraform Variables

It is helpful to create a "tfvars" file to store the variables for your
deployment. You can deploy multiple Vault servers by maintaining multiple
varfiles.

The examples for the variables will use the Tech Services Sandbox account
values. :exclamation: means the variable is required.
